sentence=SimpleEncoder is a library that makes it easy to use rotary encoders with Arduino's.
paragraph=<p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a very basic library that makes the use of a rotary encoder very simple. You simply call the library and pass in the pin numbers assigned to your encoder:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>SimpleEncoder encoder(buttonPin, pinA, pinB);</strong></p><p>, then you can do these things:</p><ul><li>Check if the encoder is moving up</li><li>Check if the encoder is moving down</li><li>Check if the encoder is idle</li><li>Check if the button is being pressed.</li></ul><p>You do this using simple terms:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>if (encoder.UP) {}<br />if (encoder.DOWN) {}<br />if (encoder.IDLE) {}<br />if (encoder.BUTTON) {}</strong></p><p>You can also set a value that you want to track by additionally passing into the library call, the initial value, the lower limit and the upper limit, then each time you check on that value, the library increases or decreases it based on the current state of the encoder.</p><p>You will get the most efficient use of this library, if you call the encoder states from your loop and if your project uses NON-BLOCKING timers (such as <strong><a href="http://github.com/EasyG0ing1/BlockNot">BlockNot</a></strong>) as opposed to <strong>delay()</strong> so that the encoder will be checked as often as possible.</p><p>There are two example sketches and for&nbsp;more information, view the readme <a href="http://github.com/EasyG0ing1/SimpleEncoder">by clicking here</a></p>
